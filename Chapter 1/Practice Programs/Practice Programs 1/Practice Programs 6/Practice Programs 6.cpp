// Practice Programs 6.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Jacques van den Berg

/*
The purpose of this exercise is to produce a catalog of typical syntax errors and error messages that will be encountered by a beginner and to 
continue acquainting you with the programming environment. 
This exercise should leave you with a knowledge of what error to look for when given any of a number of common error messages.
Your instructor may have a program for you to use for this exercise. 
If not, you should use a program from one of the previous Practice Programs.
Deliberately introduce errors to the program, compile, record the error and the error message, 
fix the error, compile again (to be sure you have the program corrected), then introduce another error. 
Keep the catalog of errors and add program errors and messages to it as you continue through this course.
The sequence of suggested errors to introduce is: 
a. Put an extra space between the < and the iostream file name. 
b. Omit one of the < or > symbols in the include directive. 
c. Omit the int from int main(). 
d. Omit or misspell the word main. 
e. Omit one of the (); then omit both the (). 
f. Continue in this fashion, deliberately misspelling identifiers (cout, cin, and so on). Omit one or both of the << in the cout statement; leave off the ending curly brace }.

// Tips for Getting Started: 
//   1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files
//   2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control
//   3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages
//   4. Use the Error List window to view errors
//   5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project
//   6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > Project and select the .sln file
